Compsys 704 Assignment 1

Automated Bottling System

This is a project for the Compsys 704 course at the University of Auckland. The project is to design and implement a system to automate the bottling process for a soft drink company. The system is to be implemented using the SystemJ programming language running on top of Java.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
sysj - Contains the SystemJ source code for the project RunConfig - A folder containing the launch files for the project.
src - A folder containing the source code for the project, including the user interfaces.
      run - Classes to run the GUI systems.
      
Running the Project
The project can be run using the launch files in the RunConfig folder. The launch files are as follows:
BuildAll - Builds the project.
BuildAllECS - Builds ECS
BuildAllSACS - Builds SACS
RunControllerl - Runs the project, including the POS system required to make orders.

Build/Run<Device> - Runs/Builds the specified device.

To run the project as intended, build all the devices and then run them simultaneously with RunAll. The POS system will then allow you to make orders and the system will automatically process them.
